"""Hatchling build hook for generating packaged assets.

This module implements a custom Hatchling build hook that generates
packaged assets from the .claude/** directory at build time.

The build hook:
1. Reads from .claude/** (development source of truth)
2. Filters using AssetManifest (curated subset)
3. Writes to src/claude_pilot/assets/.claude/** (packaged assets)
4. Ensures wheel contains only generated assets, not templates

This approach eliminates drift between development and packaged assets.
