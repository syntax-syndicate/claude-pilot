## Slash Command Workflow

### Core Commands

```
/00_plan (planning) --> /01_confirm (extraction + review) --> /02_execute (TDD + Ralph) --> /03_close (archive)
                                                                                   |
                                                                                   v
                                                                          /90_review (anytime)
```

### Phase Boundary Protection (Updated 2026-01-15)

The `/00_plan` command includes **Level 3 (Strong) phase boundary protection** to prevent ambiguous confirmations from triggering execution.

#### Key Features

1. **Pattern-Based Detection**: Language-agnostic approach (no word lists)
2. **MANDATORY AskUserQuestion**: Multi-option confirmation at plan completion
3. **Valid Execution Triggers**: Only explicit commands allow phase transition

#### AskUserQuestion Template

```markdown
AskUserQuestion:
  What would you like to do next?
  A) Continue refining the plan
  B) Explore alternative approaches
  C) Run /01_confirm (save plan for execution)
  D) Run /02_execute (start implementation immediately)
```

#### Valid Execution Triggers

- User explicitly types `/01_confirm` or `/02_execute`
- User explicitly says "start coding now" or "begin implementation"
- User selects option C or D from AskUserQuestion

**All other responses** (including "go ahead", "proceed", "그래 그렇게 해") → Continue planning or re-call AskUserQuestion.

#### Anti-Patterns

- **NEVER** use Yes/No questions at phase boundaries
- **NEVER** try to detect specific words or phrases
- **ALWAYS** provide explicit multi-option choices
- **ALWAYS** call AskUserQuestion when uncertain about user intent

### /01_confirm Command Workflow

The `/01_confirm` command extracts the plan from the `/00_plan` conversation and creates a plan file in `.pilot/plan/pending/`.

#### Step Sequence

1. **Step 1: Extract Plan from Conversation**
   - Review context for requirements, scope, architecture, execution plan
   - Validate completeness (User Requirements, Execution Plan, Acceptance Criteria, Test Plan)

2. **Step 1.5: Conversation Highlights Extraction** (NEW)
   - Extract code examples (fenced code blocks)
   - Extract syntax patterns (CLI commands, API patterns)
   - Extract architecture diagrams (ASCII art, Mermaid charts)
   - Mark with `> **FROM CONVERSATION:**` prefix
   - Add to plan under "Execution Context → Implementation Patterns"

3. **Step 2: Generate Plan File Name**
   - Create timestamped filename: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_{work_name}.md`

4. **Step 3: Create Plan File**
   - Use plan template structure
   - Include Execution Context with Implementation Patterns
   - Add External Service Integration (if applicable)

5. **Step 4: Auto-Review**
   - Run Gap Detection Review (unless `--no-review`)
   - Interactive Recovery for BLOCKING findings
   - Support `--lenient` flag to bypass BLOCKING

#### Plan File Structure

```markdown
# {Work Name}
- Generated: {timestamp} | Work: {work_name} | Location: {plan_path}

## User Requirements
## PRP Analysis (What/Why/How/Success Criteria/Constraints)
## Scope
## Test Environment (Detected)
## Execution Context (Planner Handoff)
### Explored Files
### Key Decisions Made
### Implementation Patterns (FROM CONVERSATION)  <-- Step 1.5 output
## External Service Integration [if applicable]
## Architecture
## Vibe Coding Compliance
## Execution Plan
## Acceptance Criteria
## Test Plan
## Risks & Mitigations
## Open Questions
```

#### Integration Points

| Component | Integration | Data Flow |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `/00_plan` | Produces conversation | → `/01_confirm` extracts |
| `/01_confirm` | Creates plan file | → `.pilot/plan/pending/` |
| `/01_confirm` Step 1.5 | Extracts highlights | → Plan Implementation Patterns |
| Gap Detection | Reviews external services | → Interactive Recovery |
| `/02_execute` | Reads plan file | ← `.pilot/plan/in_progress/` |

---

## Interactive Recovery

### Trigger Conditions

- BLOCKING findings detected during auto-review
- No `--lenient` flag present
- Max 5 iterations

### Flow

```
BLOCKING > 0?
  |
  +-- Yes: Present findings
  |        |
  |        +-- AskUserQuestion for each BLOCKING
  |        |
  |        +-- Update plan with responses
  |        |
  |        +-- Re-run review
  |        |
  |        +-- BLOCKING = 0? → Exit
  |
  +-- No: Proceed to STOP
```

### Plan Update Format

```markdown
## External Service Integration
### API Calls Required
| Call | From | To | Endpoint | SDK/HTTP | Status |
|------|------|----|----------|----------|--------|
| [Description] | [Service] | [Service] | [Path] | [Package] | [New] |

[OR if skipped]
> ⚠️ SKIPPED: Deferred to implementation phase
```

## Plan Management

### Directory Structure

```
.pilot/plan/
├── pending/        # Awaiting confirmation (created by /01_confirm)
├── in_progress/    # Currently executing (moved by /02_execute)
├── done/           # Completed plans (moved by /03_close)
└── active/         # Branch pointers (current plan per branch)
```

### Lifecycle

```
/01_confirm → pending/{timestamp}_{name}.md
/02_execute → in_progress/{timestamp}_{name}.md
/03_close   → done/{timestamp}_{name}.md
              active/{branch}.txt (pointer)
```

## Agent Invocation Patterns

### Agent File Format (YAML Frontmatter)

As of v3.2.0, all agent files use official Claude Code CLI YAML format:

**Valid Format**:
```yaml
---
name: coder
description: TDD implementation agent
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, TodoWrite
skills: tdd, ralph-loop, vibe-coding, git-master
---

You are the Coder Agent. Implement features using TDD...
```

**Format Requirements**:
- `tools`: Comma-separated string (NOT array)
- `skills`: Comma-separated string (NOT array)
- `instructions`: Body content after `---` (NOT frontmatter field)

### Imperative Command Structure

As of v3.2.0, all agent invocations use **MANDATORY ACTION** sections with imperative language to ensure reliable agent delegation.

#### Pattern Structure

```markdown
### 🚀 MANDATORY ACTION: {Action Name}

> **YOU MUST invoke the following agents NOW using the Task tool.**
> This is not optional. Execute these Task tool calls immediately.

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT SKIP**:

[Specific Task tool calls with parameters]

**VERIFICATION**: After sending Task calls, wait for agents to return results before proceeding.
```

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| 🚀 MANDATORY ACTION header | Visual emphasis for blocking action | "Parallel Agent Invocation" |
| YOU MUST invoke... NOW | Direct imperative command | "YOU MUST invoke the following agents NOW" |
| EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT SKIP | Emphasis on blocking nature | Prevents skipping to later steps |
| VERIFICATION instruction | Wait directive | "wait for both agents to return" |
| "send in same message" | Parallel execution hint | For concurrent Task calls |

### Command-Specific Patterns

| Command | Step | Agents | Pattern |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| `/00_plan` | Step 0 | explorer + researcher | Parallel: "send in same message" |
| `/01_confirm` | Step 4 | plan-reviewer | Sequential: Single Task call |
| `/02_execute` | Step 2.3 | Multiple coders | Parallel: One Task call per independent SC |
| `/02_execute` | Step 2.4 | tester + validator + code-reviewer | Parallel: "send in same message" |
| `/02_execute` | Step 3 | coder | Sequential: Single Task call with TDD |
| `/03_close` | Step 5 | documenter | Sequential: Single Task call |
| `/90_review` | Main | plan-reviewer | Sequential or parallel (3-angle) |
| `/91_document` | Main | documenter | **OPTIONAL**: May use main thread |

## Parallel Execution Integration

### Overview

claude-pilot supports parallel agent execution for maximum workflow efficiency. This reduces execution time by 50-70% while improving quality through agent specialization.

### Parallel Patterns by Command

#### /00_plan: Parallel Exploration

```
Main Orchestrator
       │
       ├─► Explorer Agent (Haiku) - Codebase exploration
       └─► Researcher Agent (Haiku) - External docs research
              ↓
       [Result Merge → Plan Creation]
```

**Implementation**:
- Uses **MANDATORY ACTION** section at Step 0
- Two Task calls sent in **same message** for true parallelism
- Explorer returns: Explored Files table, Key Decisions
- Researcher returns: Research Findings table with sources
- VERIFICATION checkpoint ensures both complete before proceeding

#### /02_execute: Parallel SC Implementation

```
Main Orchestrator
       │
       ├─► Coder-SC1 (Sonnet) - Independent SC
       ├─► Coder-SC2 (Sonnet) - Independent SC
       ├─► Coder-SC3 (Sonnet) - Independent SC
              ↓
       [Result Integration]
              ↓
       ├─► Tester Agent (Sonnet) - Test execution
       ├─► Validator Agent (Haiku) - Type+Lint+Coverage
       └─► Code-Reviewer Agent (Opus) - Deep review
              ↓
       [Ralph Loop Verification]
```

**Implementation**:
- Uses **MANDATORY ACTION** sections at Steps 2.3 and 2.4
- SC dependency analysis before parallel execution
- Independent SCs run concurrently (one Task call per SC)
- Verification agents run in parallel after integration
- VERIFICATION checkpoints after each parallel phase
- Code-reviewer uses Opus for catching async bugs, memory leaks

#### /01_confirm & /90_review: Agent Delegation

```
/01_confirm → Plan-Reviewer Agent (Sonnet)
            - Gap Detection Review
            - Interactive Recovery for BLOCKING issues

/90_review → Plan-Reviewer Agent (Sonnet)
            - Multi-angle parallel review (optional)
            - Security, Quality, Testing, Architecture
```

### Agent Invocation Syntax

```markdown
Task:
  subagent_type: {agent_name}
  prompt: |
    {task_description}
    {context}
    {expected_output}
```

### Model Allocation for Parallel Work

| Model | Parallel Tasks | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Haiku | explorer, researcher, validator | Fast, cost-efficient |
| Sonnet | coder, tester, plan-reviewer | Quality + speed balance |
| Opus | code-reviewer | Deep reasoning for critical review |

### File Conflict Prevention

- Each parallel agent works on different files
- SC dependency analysis identifies file ownership
- Clear merge strategy after parallel phase
- Integration tests verify merged results

### Integration Points

| Component | Integration | Data Flow |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `/00_plan` | Parallel: Explorer + Researcher | → Merged plan structure |
| `/02_execute` | Parallel: Coder (per SC) | → Integrated code |
| `/02_execute` | Parallel: Tester + Validator + Code-Reviewer | → Verification results |
| `/01_confirm` | Delegates to plan-reviewer | → Gap Detection report |

### Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Speed | 50-70% execution time reduction |
| Context Isolation | 8x token efficiency |
| Quality | Specialized agents per task |
| Scalability | Independent tasks run concurrently |
