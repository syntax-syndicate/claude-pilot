# /02_execute

_Execute plan using Ralph Loop TDD pattern - iterate until all tests pass._

## Core Philosophy

- **Single source of truth**: Plan file drives the work
- **One active plan**: Exactly one plan active per git branch
- **No drift**: Update plan and todo list if scope changes
- **Evidence required**: Never claim completion without verification output

---

## Step 0: Source Worktree Utilities

```bash
WORKTREE_UTILS=".claude/scripts/worktree-utils.sh"
[ -f "$WORKTREE_UTILS" ] && . "$WORKTREE_UTILS" || echo "Warning: Worktree utilities not found"
```

---

## Step 1: Plan State Transition (ATOMIC)

> **🚨 CRITICAL - BLOCKING OPERATION**
> This step MUST complete successfully BEFORE any other work begins.
> If this step fails, EXIT IMMEDIATELY. Do not proceed to Step 2.

### 1.1 Worktree Mode (--wt)

> **🚨 CRITICAL - Worktree mode also follows atomic priority**
> Plan MUST be moved to in_progress before any worktree setup.

```bash
if is_worktree_mode "$@"; then
    # ATOMIC BLOCK START - Worktree must move plan FIRST
    check_worktree_support || { echo "Error: Git worktree not supported" >&2; exit 1; }
    PENDING_PLAN="$(select_oldest_pending)" || { echo "No pending plans. Run /00_plan first" >&2; exit 1; }

    # Move plan to in_progress BEFORE creating worktree
    echo "🔒 Moving plan to in_progress (BLOCKING - Worktree mode)..."
    PLAN_FILENAME="$(basename "$PENDING_PLAN")"
    IN_PROGRESS_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/in_progress/${PLAN_FILENAME}"
    mkdir -p "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/in_progress"

    mv "$PENDING_PLAN" "$IN_PROGRESS_PATH" || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to move plan to in_progress. Aborting worktree setup." >&2
        exit 1
    }
    PLAN_PATH="$IN_PROGRESS_PATH"
    echo "✅ Plan moved: $PLAN_FILENAME"

    # NOW proceed with worktree setup
    BRANCH_NAME="$(plan_to_branch "$PLAN_FILENAME")"
    MAIN_BRANCH="main"; git rev-parse --verify "$MAIN_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1 || MAIN_BRANCH="master"
    WORKTREE_DIR="$(create_worktree "$BRANCH_NAME" "$PLAN_FILENAME" "$MAIN_BRANCH")" || exit 1
    # ... (full worktree setup in backup)
    PLAN_PATH="$IN_PROGRESS_PATH"; cd "$WORKTREE_ABS" || exit 1
    # ATOMIC BLOCK END
fi
```

### 1.2 Select and Move Plan (ATOMIC BLOCK)

> **🚨 CRITICAL - BLOCKING OPERATION**
> This entire block is ATOMIC. All three operations MUST complete successfully:
> 1. Select plan (pending or in_progress)
> 2. Move pending → in_progress (if applicable)
> 3. Create active pointer
>
> **DO NOT** split these operations. If any fail, exit immediately.

```bash
# Project root detection (always use project root, not current directory)
PROJECT_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"

# ATOMIC BLOCK START - DO NOT SPLIT
PLAN_PATH="${EXPLICIT_PATH}"

# Priority 1: Explicit path from args
# Priority 2: Oldest pending plan (requires move)
[ -z "$PLAN_PATH" ] && PLAN_PATH="$(ls -1t "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/pending"/*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1)"

# IF pending plan found, MUST move it FIRST
if [ -n "$PLAN_PATH" ] && printf "%s" "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -q "/pending/"; then
    echo "🔒 Moving plan to in_progress (BLOCKING)..."
    PLAN_FILENAME="$(basename "$PLAN_PATH")"
    IN_PROGRESS_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/in_progress/${PLAN_FILENAME}"
    mkdir -p "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/in_progress"

    mv "$PLAN_PATH" "$IN_PROGRESS_PATH" || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to move plan to in_progress. Aborting." >&2
        exit 1
    }
    PLAN_PATH="$IN_PROGRESS_PATH"
    echo "✅ Plan moved: $PLAN_FILENAME"
fi

# Priority 3: Most recent in_progress (no move needed)
[ -z "$PLAN_PATH" ] && PLAN_PATH="$(ls -1t "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/in_progress"/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)"

# Final validation
[ -z "$PLAN_PATH" ] || [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ] && {
    echo "❌ No plan found. Run /00_plan first" >&2
    exit 1
}

# Create active pointer (part of atomic block)
mkdir -p "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/active"
BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo detached)"
KEY="$(printf "%s" "$BRANCH" | sed -E 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]+/_/g')"
printf "%s" "$PLAN_PATH" > "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pilot/plan/active/${KEY}.txt"
echo "✅ Active pointer created for branch: $BRANCH"
# ATOMIC BLOCK END
```

---

## Step 2: Convert Plan to Todo List

Read plan, extract: Deliverables, Phases, Tasks, Acceptance Criteria, Test Plan, Open Questions

Create todo list mirroring plan phases. Rules: Atomic/verifiable todos, **exactly one `in_progress` at a time (sequential work)**, mark complete immediately after finishing

**Parallel Group Rule**: When executing parallel tasks (multiple Task calls in same message):
- Mark ALL parallel items as `in_progress` simultaneously
- Use [Parallel Group N] prefix to indicate parallel execution
- Complete them together when ALL agents return

**MANDATORY**: After EVERY "Implement", "Add", "Create" todo, add a corresponding "Run tests for [X]" todo immediately after.

---

## Step 2.5: SC Dependency Analysis (For Parallel Execution)

> **Purpose**: Identify which Success Criteria can be implemented in parallel

### 2.1 Analyze SC Dependencies

For each Success Criterion (SC), determine:
- **Files affected**: Which files will be modified/created?
- **Dependencies**: Does this SC depend on other SCs?
- **Integration points**: Shared components or interfaces?

### 2.2 Group Independent SCs

Create parallel execution groups:

| Group | SCs | Rationale |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| Group 1 | SC-1, SC-2, SC-3 | Independent, no shared files |
| Group 2 | SC-4, SC-5 | Depend on Group 1 completion |
| Group 3 | SC-6 | Depends on SC-4 |

### 2.3 Parallel Execution Pattern

### 🚀 MANDATORY ACTION: Parallel Coder Agent Invocation

> **When multiple independent SCs exist, YOU MUST invoke multiple coder agents NOW using the Task tool.**
> This is not optional. Execute these Task tool calls immediately in the same message.

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT SKIP**:

```markdown
# For Group 1 (Independent SCs)
Task:
  subagent_type: coder
  prompt: |
    Execute SC-1: {DESCRIPTION}
    Plan Path: {PLAN_PATH}
    Test Scenarios: {TS_LIST}
    Implement using TDD + Ralph Loop. Return summary only.

Task:
  subagent_type: coder
  prompt: |
    Execute SC-2: {DESCRIPTION}
    Plan Path: {PLAN_PATH}
    Test Scenarios: {TS_LIST}
    Implement using TDD + Ralph Loop. Return summary only.

Task:
  subagent_type: coder
  prompt: |
    Execute SC-3: {DESCRIPTION}
    Plan Path: {PLAN_PATH}
    Test Scenarios: {TS_LIST}
    Implement using TDD + Ralph Loop. Return summary only.
```

**VERIFICATION**: After sending Task calls, wait for all Coder agents to return results before proceeding to Step 2.4.

**After all parallel Coder agents complete**:
1. Integrate results
2. Run parallel verification (Step 2.4)
3. Proceed to Group 2 (dependent SCs)

### 2.4 Parallel Verification Phase

### 🚀 MANDATORY ACTION: Parallel Verification Agent Invocation

> **After parallel Coder implementation, YOU MUST invoke verification agents NOW using the Task tool.**
> This is not optional. Execute these Task tool calls immediately in the same message.

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT SKIP**:

```markdown
Task:
  subagent_type: tester
  prompt: |
    Run tests and verify coverage for implemented SCs.
    Test Command: {TEST_CMD}
    Coverage Command: {COVERAGE_CMD}
    Return test results summary.

Task:
  subagent_type: validator
  prompt: |
    Run type check and lint for implemented code.
    Type Check: {TYPE_CMD}
    Lint: {LINT_CMD}
    Return verification status.

Task:
  subagent_type: code-reviewer
  prompt: |
    Review the implemented code for:
    - Async bugs, memory leaks, race conditions
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Code quality and Vibe Coding compliance
    - Performance issues

    Files changed:
    {FILE_LIST}

    Return comprehensive review with findings.
```

**VERIFICATION**: After sending Task calls, wait for all verification agents to return results before proceeding to Step 2.5.

### 2.5 File Conflict Prevention

To prevent parallel agents from editing the same file:
- Each Coder agent should work on different files
- Use clear file ownership per SC
- Coordinate shared interfaces in advance
- Merge results after parallel phase

### 2.6 Fallback to Sequential

If SCs have dependencies or share files:
- Use sequential execution (original pattern)
- One Coder agent for all SCs
- Traditional TDD + Ralph Loop

---

## Step 3: Delegate to Coder Agent (Context Isolation)

### 🚀 MANDATORY ACTION: Coder Agent Invocation

> **CRITICAL**: YOU MUST invoke the Coder Agent NOW using the Task tool for context isolation.
> This is not optional. Execute this Task tool call immediately.

> **Why Agent?**: Coder Agent runs in **isolated context window** (~80K tokens internally). All file reading, test execution, error analysis happens there. Only summary returns here, preserving main orchestrator context (~5K tokens vs 110K+ without isolation).

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT SKIP**:

```markdown
Task:
  subagent_type: coder
  prompt: |
    Execute the following plan:

    Plan Path: {PLAN_PATH}

    Success Criteria:
    {SC_LIST_FROM_PLAN}

    Test Scenarios:
    {TS_LIST_FROM_PLAN}

    Implement using TDD + Ralph Loop. Return summary only.

**VERIFICATION**: After sending Task call, wait for Coder agent to return results before proceeding to Step 3.3.

```

### 3.3 Process Coder Results

#### Expected Output Format: `<CODER_COMPLETE>`

```markdown
## Coder Agent Summary

### Implementation Complete ✅
- Success Criteria Met: SC-1, SC-2, SC-3
- Files Changed: 3
  - `src/auth/login.ts`: Added JWT validation
  - `src/auth/logout.ts`: Added session cleanup
  - `tests/auth.test.ts`: Added 5 tests

### Verification Results
- Tests: ✅ All pass (15/15)
- Type Check: ✅ Clean
- Lint: ✅ No issues
- Coverage: ✅ 85% (80% target met)

### Ralph Loop Iterations
- Total: 3 iterations
- Final Status: <CODER_COMPLETE>

### Follow-ups
- None
```

#### Output: `<CODER_BLOCKED>`

If Coder outputs `<CODER_BLOCKED>`:

```markdown
## Coder Agent Summary

### Implementation Blocked ⚠️
- Status: <CODER_BLOCKED>
- Reason: Cannot achieve 80% coverage threshold
- Current Coverage: 72%
- Missing: Edge case tests for error paths

### Recommendation
- User intervention needed for edge cases
- Consider lowering threshold or documenting exceptions
```

**Action Required**: Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather user guidance:
- Should we continue with lower coverage?
- Can you provide edge case examples?
- Should we document this as a known limitation?

---

## Step 4: Execute with TDD (Legacy - Use Agent Instead)

> **NOTE**: This step is preserved for backward compatibility. For new plans, use **Step 3: Delegate to Coder Agent** instead.

**TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)**: See @.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md

### 4.1 Discovery
Search codebase: `Glob **/*{keyword}*`, `Grep {pattern}`

### 4.2 Red Phase: Write Failing Tests
For each SC-N: Generate test stub, Write assertions, Run → confirm RED

### 4.3 Green Phase: Minimal Implementation
Write ONLY enough code to pass. Run → confirm GREEN

### 4.4 Refactor Phase: Clean Up
Improve quality (DRY, SOLID), Run ALL tests → confirm GREEN

### 4.5 TDD-Ralph Integration (CRITICAL)

**After EVERY Edit/Write tool call, you MUST run tests immediately.**

**Ralph Micro-Cycle**:
1. Edit/Write code
2. Mark test todo as in_progress
3. Run tests (use detected test command)
4. Analyze results
5. Fix failures or mark test todo complete
6. Repeat

**Test Command Auto-Detection**: See @.claude/guides/test-environment.md

---

## Step 5: Ralph Loop (Autonomous Completion)

**Ralph Loop**: See @.claude/skills/ralph-loop/SKILL.md

> **Principle**: Self-correcting loop until completion marker detected

### Ralph Loop Entry Condition (CRITICAL)

**Ralph Loop starts IMMEDIATELY after the FIRST code change.**

**Correct Entry Points**:
- ✅ After implementing first feature/function
- ✅ After fixing a bug
- ✅ After any Edit/Write tool call

**❌ WRONG**: After completing all todos, at very end

### 4.1 Completion Promise
Output `<RALPH_COMPLETE>` marker **ONLY when** ALL conditions are met:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage 80%+ (core modules 90%+)
- [ ] Type check clean
- [ ] Lint clean
- [ ] All todos completed

### 4.2 Loop Structure
```
MAX_ITERATIONS=7
WHILE ITERATION <= MAX AND NOT <RALPH_COMPLETE>:
    1. Run: tests, type-check, lint, coverage
    2. Log iteration to ralph-loop-log.md
    3. IF all pass AND coverage >= threshold AND todos complete:
         Output: <RALPH_COMPLETE>
    4. ELSE:
         Fix (priority: errors > coverage > lint)
         ITERATION++
```

### 4.3 Verification Commands

**Test Detection**: See @.claude/guides/test-environment.md

```bash
# Auto-detect test command
DETECT_TEST_CMD() {
    if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then echo "pytest"
    elif [ -f "package.json" ]; then echo "npm test"
    elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then echo "go test ./..."
    elif [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then echo "cargo test"
    else echo "npm test"; fi
}

# Run verification
$TEST_CMD
[ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q "typescript" && npx tsc --noEmit
[ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q '"lint"' && npm run lint
```

### 4.4 Exit Conditions
| Type | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| ✅ Success | All tests pass, coverage 80%+ (core 90%+), type clean, lint clean, todos complete |
| ❌ Failure | Max 7 iterations reached, unrecoverable error |
| ⚠️ Blocked | `<RALPH_BLOCKED>` output |

### 4.5 Coverage Enforcement
- Overall < 80%: Continue improving tests
- Core modules < 90%: Focus on core test coverage

---

## Step 6: Todo Continuation Enforcement

> **Principle**: Never quit halfway

**Default Rule**: One `in_progress` at a time (sequential work), mark complete RIGHT AFTER finishing, no batching, no abandonment

**Parallel Group Rule**: When executing parallel tasks (multiple Task calls in same message):
- Mark ALL parallel items as `in_progress` simultaneously
- Use [Parallel Group N] prefix to indicate parallel execution
- Complete them together when ALL agents return

---

## Step 7: Verification

```bash
echo "Running type check..."; npx tsc --noEmit; TYPE_CHECK_RESULT=$?
echo "Running tests..."; npm run test; TEST_RESULT=$?
echo "Running lint..."; npm run lint; LINT_RESULT=$?
[ $TYPE_CHECK_RESULT -eq 0 ] && [ $TEST_RESULT -eq 0 ] && [ $LINT_RESULT -eq 0 ] && echo "✅ All passed" || { echo "❌ Some failed"; exit 1; }
```

---

## Step 8: Update Plan Artifacts

```bash
cat >> "$PLAN_PATH" << 'EOF'
## Execution Summary
### Changes Made: [List]
### Verification: Type ✅, Tests ✅ (X% coverage), Lint ✅
### Follow-ups: [Items]
EOF
```

---

## Step 9: Auto-Chain to Documentation

> **Principle**: 3-sync pattern - implementation complete → docs auto-sync

### 9.1 Trigger (all must be true)
- [ ] All todos complete, [ ] Ralph Loop exited successfully
- [ ] Coverage 80%+ overall, 90%+ core, [ ] Type + lint clean

### 9.2 Auto-Invoke
```
Skill: 91_document
Args: auto-sync from {RUN_ID}
```

### 9.3 Skip
If `--no-docs` specified, skip documentation

---

## Success Criteria

| Criteria | Verification |
|----------|-------------|
| Plan executed | All phases completed |
| Tests pass | All SC met |
| Type clean | Type check exits 0 |
| Lint clean | Lint exits 0 |
| Coverage | 80%+ overall, 90%+ core |
| Ready for close | Documentation synced |

---

## Workflow
```
/00_plan → /01_confirm → /02_execute → /03_close
                      ↓
                [Ralph Loop → TDD Cycle → 91_document]
```
