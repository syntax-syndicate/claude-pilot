# SKILL: Git Master (Version Control Workflow)

> **Purpose**: Execute Git operations with best practices - commits, branches, PRs
> **Target**: Coder Agent after completing implementation

---

## Quick Start

### When to Use This Skill
- Stage and commit changes
- Create feature branches
- Create pull requests

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Stage and commit (ONLY when user requests)
git status && git diff && git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(scope): description\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Create PR: gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
```

---

## What This Skill Covers

### In Scope
- Git staging and committing (on user request)
- Conventional commit messages
- Co-Authored-By attribution
- Branch creation and PR creation

### Out of Scope
- Force pushes to main/master
- Git configuration changes
- Repository initialization

---

## Core Principles

### Commit ONLY When Requested

**CRITICAL**: Never create commits unless user explicitly asks.

**User requests commit**: `/commit`, "Create a commit", "Commit these changes", "Make a commit for this work"
**NOT requests**: "Fix this bug", "Add feature X", `/03_close`

### Conventional Commits

Format: `type(scope): description`

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, style, test

### Co-Authored-By Attribution

Always include:
```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
