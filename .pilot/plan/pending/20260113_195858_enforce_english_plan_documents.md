# Enforce English Plan Documents

- Generated: 2026-01-13 19:58:58 | Work: enforce_english_plan_documents

## User Requirements

The user reported that plan documents generated by `/01_confirm` are written in Korean when the conversation is conducted in Korean. The user wants plan documents to always be written in English, regardless of the conversation language.

---

## PRP Analysis

### What (Functionality)

**Objective**: Add explicit language directives to command files to ensure plan documents are always generated in English.

**Scope**:
- Modify `00_plan.md` to include English language requirement
- Modify `01_confirm.md` to explicitly require English output in plan files

### Why (Context)

**Current State**: Plan documents inherit the conversation language. When users discuss in Korean, plans are generated in Korean.

**Desired State**: Plan documents are always written in English regardless of conversation language.

**Business Value**:
- Consistent documentation across teams
- Better collaboration in multilingual environments
- Standardized outputs that can be shared internationally

### How (Approach)

- **Phase 1**: Add language directive to `00_plan.md` Core Philosophy section
- **Phase 2**: Add language requirement to `01_confirm.md` Step 3 (Create Plan File)

### Success Criteria

```
SC-1: Plan documents generated in English
- Verify: Run /00_plan in Korean, then /01_confirm
- Expected: Plan file content is in English
```

### Constraints

- Minimal changes to existing command structure
- Should not affect conversation language (users can still discuss in any language)
- Only plan file output should be English

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- `.claude/commands/00_plan.md` - Add English language directive
- `.claude/commands/01_confirm.md` - Add English output requirement

### Out of Scope
- Conversation language settings
- Other command files (02_execute, 03_close, etc.)
- `.claude/settings.json` language setting (already set to "en")

---

## Architecture

### Module Boundaries

**Files to Modify**:

1. `.claude/commands/00_plan.md`
   - Add to Core Philosophy: "Plan Output Language: All plan documents must be written in English"

2. `.claude/commands/01_confirm.md`
   - Add to Step 3.1 Structure: Language requirement note
   - Add explicit instruction before plan content generation

### Vibe Coding Compliance

> N/A - This is a documentation/command file change, not code

## Test Plan

| ID | Scenario | Input | Expected | Type |
|----|----------|-------|----------|------|
| TS-1 | Korean conversation | /00_plan in Korean | Plan summary in English | Manual |
| TS-2 | Confirm creates English file | /01_confirm after Korean /00_plan | Plan file in English | Manual |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Directive ignored by LLM | Low | Medium | Place directive prominently, use clear imperative language |
| Mixed language output | Low | Low | Add explicit "translate if needed" instruction |

---

## Open Questions

None - requirements are clear.

## Review History

### Review #1 (2026-01-13 19:59)

**Findings Applied**:
| Type | Count | Applied |
|------|-------|---------|
| Critical | 0 | 0 |
| Warning | 0 | 0 |
| Suggestion | 2 | 2 |

**Changes Made**:
1. **[Suggestion] Architecture - Directive Format**
   - Issue: Directive visibility could be improved
   - Applied: Recommend using callout format `> **⚠️ LANGUAGE**:` in command files

2. **[Suggestion] Architecture - Directive Placement**
   - Issue: Directive should be prominent
   - Applied: Place directive near top of each file, after Core Philosophy section
